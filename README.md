# MNIST-Image-Generation-GAN

This is a simple GAN network based on this amazing and simple [article](https://www.oreilly.com/learning/generative-adversarial-networks-for-beginners). The network generates new images based on the learning data which is MNIST in this case.

This is a very simple network but really good for people who are just starting with GAN!
